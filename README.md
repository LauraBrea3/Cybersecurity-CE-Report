  Ukraine Ransomware
  Resource (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40428967)


The Ukraine ransomware was a malware attack with worm-like properties, hackers were able to gain access into many companies by hacking into the MEDoc’s software updates and sending out corrupted updates to clients. The software’s automatic update system was compromised and used to download and run malware instead of the updates for the software.  

The way that the vulnerability was discovered was when many companies started experiencing issues with their orders and shipments, for example the shipping company Maersk said they were not able to process orders and thus creating delays to consignments.  Also a Cadbury factory in Tasmania had to stop manufacturing when their computer systems went down after the attack.  This cyber-attack caused issues around the world and in companies in 64 countries including banks in Ukraine, Russian oil companies, British advertising companies and a US law firm and these were just a free out of the many companies that were affected by this ransomware.

The default tax software in Ukraine is MEdoc and this is how the attackers were able to exploit the vulnerability, they were smart enough to know that many of the companies that do business with Ukraine all must use the same tax filing system.  Therefore by infiltrating the software’s automatic updates they were able to gain access to all of these different companies around the world.

Some security measures that could have been taken to prevent this attack was that the software company should have tested out the update and checked for any possible breaches before sending out the automatic updates.  Also the companies using this software should have had anti-virus or malware detecting programs installed on their computers and maybe not have their updates set to automatic.  Yes we all have our updates automatically so that we don’t have to worry about them but for big companies like that they should have extra measures in place to prevent cyber attacks.  I’m sure after this attack both software companies as well as their consumers have set more strict policies for installing the initial software as well as their updates.



Cyberattack on Yahoo in 2014
Resources(https://techmonitor.ai/technology/biggest-cyberattacks-in-history ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-cyber/yahoo-says-hackers-stole-data-from-500-million-accounts-in-2014-idUSKCN11S16P)

In 2014 a latvian hacker hired by Russian agents hacked Yahoo.  Over 500 million accounts were stolen.  He was able to gain access to Yahoo’s user database and account management tool through the use of a Phishing campaign that was specifically targeted to Yahoo employees.  They stole email addresses, passwords, telephone numbers, dates of birth and names.  They did not however get into the protected passwords, or payment and bank account information.  

The attack happened in 2014 but it was not discovered until 2016 and the only reason it was discovered was because Yahoo was investigating another breach which turned out to be false and in their investigation they found the 2014 breach.  Also in July of 2016 around 200 million Yahoo accounts were presented for sale on the darknet market website called “TheRealDeal”.  The seller admitted to have been selling the data since late 2015.

After being investigated by U.S intelligence officials they said they believe the attack was state-sponsored because it resembled previous hacks traced to Russian intelligence agencies or hackers acting on their behalf.  Yahoo  reported that the hackers likely used manufactured web cookies to falsify login credentials which allowed them to gain access to any account without a password.

Security measures that could have been taken in order to prevent this attack could have been to require all Yahoo users to have two step verification on their accounts. This would have made the use of the manufactured web cookies harder and the hackers would not have been able to falsify the credentials as easily.  Yahoo’s cybersecurity team should also have been doing more security checks as well.  It is unacceptable that these breaches happened in 2014 and were only discovered in 2016 because they suspected a different breach, this tells you that their cybersecurity team is definitely not doing their job.  I’m sure Yahoo has upped their game and put more strict security measures in place after this incident because they lost a lot of money as well as customers and their stocks also suffered a great deal.
